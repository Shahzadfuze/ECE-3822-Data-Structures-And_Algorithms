What each filter does


Output_01:
	What I am guessing this filter does is it is a low pass filter because
	the noisy data has a peak to peak of 1 and -1 well the filter data has
	a peak to peak of around 0.45 to -0.45.

Output_02:
	Now this one seems a little more interesting because, it keeps some of the
	noise compared to the previous filter that made it an almost perfect sin wave
	as well as at the end peaks up a little more than the previous. I have to
	guess it is another low pass filter but worse because of the noise. So
	maybe a high pass filter. But that would explain the peak being the same
	as the previous filter

Output_03:
	My only guess could be something called a bandpass filter. Which only allows
	a set frequency to go through and rejects others. Which might be whats going on with this
	signal like its keeping a consistant line right above 0.2 almost never going below that
	and allowing the higher freqs to go through untouched. That is just a guess though and
	I am not entirely sure.
