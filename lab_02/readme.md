# Lab 2

## Purpose
The purpose of Lab 2 is to implement `stack` and `queue` classes in Python. 

### Stack
A `stack` is a Last-In First-Out data structure which
means that the most recent data to be _pushed_ onto
the stack is the one that will be returned on the next
_pop_ operation. Think of it as a pile of data. You
throw new data on the top of the pile for storage, and
you retrieve data one at a time from the top of the 
pile.

### Queue
A `queue` is a First-In First-Out data structure. This
means that whatever data has been in storage the
longest will be the next to get retrieved during the
_pop_ operation. Think of it as a line of people 
waiting at a deli counter. The person who has been
waiting the longest is the next to be served.

### More Details
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohSzM7WtwOk)
video explains things nicely. There are many others.
Use Google (or email me) for clarification.

## Steps
[1] Use the rsync command (or equivalent) to copy the code to your directory: `rsync -rv $SHARE/lab_02 .`

[2] Edit `stack.py` so that your code produces the
expected outcome as listed in `main`.

[3] Edit `queue.py` so that your code produces the
expected outcome as listed in `main`.

[4] Submit your assignment using the `submit.py` 
command.

## Notes
Yes, I'm aware there are about a million places online
where you can just find the solution to this lab.
Solve it by yourself. I'm not interested in reading
someone else's solution - I'm interested in what _you_
have to say.

Document your code. Add a block at the top with
your name, date, and contact info, and instructions to 
run the code. Comment methods implementations as well.
Use self documenting code and meaningful variable 
names.

## Submission
The submit script will only turn in `stack.py` and `queue.py`.
